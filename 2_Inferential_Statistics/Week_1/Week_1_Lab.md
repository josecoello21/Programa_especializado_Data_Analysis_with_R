# Week 1 Lab

1. Which of the following is *false*?

**Answer:** 50% of houses in Ames are smaller than 1,499.69 square feet.

2. Suppose we took two more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. Which would you think would provide a more accurate estimate of the population mean?

**Answer:** Sample size of 1000

3. How many elements are there in this object called sample_means_small?

**Answer:** 25

4. Which of the following is true about the elements in the sampling distributions you created?

**Answer:** Each element represents a mean square footage from a simple random sample of 10 houses.

5. It makes intuitive sense that as the sample size increases, the center of the sampling distribution becomes a more reliable estimate for the true population mean. Also as the sample size increases, the variability of the sampling distribution __________.

**Answer:** decreases

6. Which of the following is false?

**Answer:** The variability of the sampling distribution with the smaller sample size (sample_means50) is smaller than the variability of the sampling distribution with the larger sample size (sample_means150).
