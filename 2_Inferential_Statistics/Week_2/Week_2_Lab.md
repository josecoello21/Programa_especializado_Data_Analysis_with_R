# Week 2 Lab

1. My distribution should be similar to others’ distributions who also collect random samples from this population, but it is likely not exactly the same since it’s a random sample.

**Answer:** True

2. For the confidence interval to be valid, the sample mean must be normally distributed and have standard error $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$. Which of the following is **not** a condition needed for this to be true?

**Answer:** The sample distribution must be nearly normal.

3. What does "95% confidence" mean?

**Answer:** 95% of random samples of size 60 will yield confidence intervals that contain the true average area of houses in Ames, Iowa.

4. What proportion of 95% confidence intervals would you expect to capture the true population mean?

**Answer:** 95%

5. What is the appropriate critical value for a 99% confidence level?

**Answer:** 2.58

6. We would expect 99% of the intervals to contain the true population mean.

**Answer:** True
