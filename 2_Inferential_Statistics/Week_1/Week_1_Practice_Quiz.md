# Week 1 Practice Quiz

1. Suppose we are interested in studying how much chocolate is consumed by Coursera students, measured in grams per week. After surveying 500 students, we calculate an average of 175 grams per week with a standard deviation of 195 grams per week.  Which of the following is not necessarily true?

**Answer:** $\mu  =  175\, \sigma  =  195$

2. Which of the following is false?

**Answer:** Standard error measures the variability in means of samples of the same size taken from different populations.

3. The ages of pennies at a particular bank follow a nearly normal  distribution with mean 10.44 years with standard deviation 9.2 years.  Say you take random samples of 30 pennies, find the mean age in each  sample, and plot the distribution of these means. Which of the following  are the best estimates for the center and spread of this distribution?

**Answer:** mean = 10.44, standard error = 1.68

4. Which of the following is true about sampling distributions?

**Answer:** Sampling distributions get closer to normality as the sample size increases.

5. To get an estimate of consumer spending in the U.S. following the  Thanksgiving holiday, 436 randomly sampled American adults were  surveyed. Their daily spending for the six-day period following  Thanksgiving averaged \$84.71. A 95% confidence interval based on this  sample is (\$80.31, \$89.11). Which of the following are true?

 I. We are 95% confident that the average spending of the 436 American adults in this sample is between \$80.31 and $89.11.

II. If  we collected many random samples of the same size and calculated a  confidence interval for daily spending for each sample, then we would  expect 95% of the intervals to contain the true population parameter.

III. We are 95% confident that the average spending of all American adults is between \$80.31 and \$89.11.

**Answer:** II and III

6. Which of the following is **false** about confidence intervals?All else held constant.

**Answer:** as the confidence level increases, the width decreases.
